                "What happened? I wake up in a room where there is no light pierce through. All I see is just a bottle of water and a letter. The letter said "Give up on Megumi, or else I will continue harassing you."
            </div>    
            <div class="content">
                So, from that, I assume that this person brought me to this room is because of Megumi. At this moment, inside my mind, all I can think of is protecting Megumi instead of finding the culprit. I ran to the door and tried to open but it's locked.
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                There are nothing other than water bottle, the letter. There are no window and only one single locked door."
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                Suddenly, there is a voice shouting for me. And he is, ISAAC. Why is he here? He suddenly open the door and tell me to run to third floor, the chemical experiment room.
            </div>    
            <div class="content">
                I ran and ran. I am almost out of breath. In the instance of walking, I imagine Megumi, praying for her safe. “Even if I lose my life, I want you to be alive, I want you to be with me.” That’s what I am shouting in my mind right now.
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                Reaching there, there is Megumi. She got tied by... DAVID?! David says, “HaHaHa... now you figured out, dumbass. I have been wanting Megumi for so long, I want her to be with me, yet you are here! You took her from me, from the beloved woman I love! I need you to disappear”
            </div> 
            <div class="content">
                Isaac suddenly stand behind me and bind me. I can’t move. He said, “I’m sorry.. *whisper* hold on a little bit, I am always on your side *whisper*” when I hear that, I decide to act through.
            </div>    
            <div class="content">
                David takes out the drug and coming closer to me.  I am trying to resist. As he is 2 feet away from me, suddenly Maryam came in and punch David, Isaac let go of me and stand in front of me.
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                Maryam said, “DAVID! I know you love Megumi but there is no reason for you to hurt Jack! What you’re doing right now it’s wrong!” Isaac said, “the reason I help Jack is because I know he is straightforward and kind person, unlike you, being such wicked being.”
            </div> 
            <div class="content">
                I said “what has actually happened? Why is Megumi being involved into this? Please tell me!” Maryam dashes in and stop David and Isaac decided to tell me what actually happened... end. Next chapter: the fight of the past history”
