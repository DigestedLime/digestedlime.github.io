                      Production of sulfuric acid is and has been linked to the

                      The production of sulfuric acid exists in many ways, such
                      as the wet sulfuric acid process, the lead chamber
                      process, but on this website, the contact process is
                      described.

                      Sulfuric acid is used in a wide variety of ways, such as a
                      domestic acidic drain cleaner, all the way to an
                      electrolyte in lead-acid batteries.

                    <li>
                      Sulfuric acid used to be manufactured at several different
                      concentrations, based on the method used to make it.
                      Nowadays, due to advancements in technology, mainly the
                      98.3% concentration is made, and all lower concentrations
                      are made by diluting the 98.3% concentration.

                    <li>
                      Sulfuric acid serves as a catalyst for hydrocarbons to
                      "completely combust", in the same manner fire does, and
                      produces "black snakes" which is just the carbon foaming
                      out.

                When it comes to preparing the sulfur for the subsequent
                reactions, one can decide to directly produce sulfur dioxide, or

                Sulfur can be recovered from natural gas and/or oil, which

                Other than creating sulfur dioxide, occassionally it is acquired
                through other reactions involving sulfur compounds, rather than
                diatomic sulfur gas.
              </p>
              <p>
                Metals often appear in sulfide ore forms, and during their
                manufacturing process, sulfur dioxide is created as a leftover
                product. One such sulfide ore are pyrites, which are iron-based.

              4Fe$_{2(s)} + $ 11O$_{2(g)} \,\to\,$ 2Fe$_2$O$_{3(s)}$

              S$_{(s)}$ + O$_{2(g)} \,\to\,$ SO$_{2(g)}$
              <br />
              <p>
                Both sulfide ores and solid sulfur follow the same process.They
                react with oxygen gas in furnaces at around 1300 K to make
                sulfur dioxide.
              </p>
              <p>
                The resulting gas is about 10% sulfur dioxide and 10% oxygen by
                volume, and has to be passed through heat exchangers to cool it
                down to 700 K, creating steam in the process.
              </p>
              <p>
                This way, for each ton of sulfuric acid, about one ton of high
                pressure steam is also produced.

              <p class="subtitle">Considerations</p>
              <p>
                As much sulfur dioxide as possible needs to be converted, as any
                potential release of sulfur dioxide can cause acid rain.
                Naturally, creating more sulfur trioxide is more financial
                beneficial for the company, so they want to optimize the
                reaction as best as possible.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the reaction, the choice of 1:1 reactants by volume is very
                specific. Despite the fact that there is a 2:1 mole ratio
                between the sulfur dioxide and oxygen gas, we use Le Chatelier's
                principle to use the excess of oxygen to shift the equilibrium
                to the right.
              </p>
              <p>
                So why not have an excessively large amount of oxygen? Ignoring
                the feasibility of acquiring said oxygen, an enormous amount of
                oxygen (say 1:1000 ; SO$_2$:O$_2$) would definitely cause very
                few effective collisions to occur. Since there are mostly oxygen
                molecules, which can't create sulfur trioxide by themselves, it
                would be futile to increase the oxygen further.
              </p>
              <p>
                Through rigorous empirical testing, the 1:1 volume ratio of
                reactants proved to be the best possible ratio for best overall
                yield of sulfur trioxide.
              </p>
              <p>
                The temperature is similarly carefully chosen. As the reaction
                is exothermic, lowering the temperature would shift the
                equilibrium to the right. Evidently, 400$^\circ$ C is not low.
                If you recall, the higher the temperature, the higher the rate
                of reaction. This means that while having a low temperature
                would benefit the concentration of the resultant sulfur
                trioxide, it would take an excessively long time to create said
                sulfur trioxide.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thus, 400$^\circ$ C is considered a compromise between two
                extremes, chosen empirically as well.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lastly, the pressure. Notice the moles on each side of the
                equilibrium equation. According to Le Chatelier's, you would
                want to increase the pressure. Turns out, atmospheric pressure
                is still enough to get a high efficiency in the reaction.
              </p>
              <p>
                The overall reaction still has approximately a 99.5% conversion.
                If we were to increase the pressure, it would be better, but
                that just isn't financially efficient.

                Contrary to what one might think, the last step does not involve
                just the addition of water. If water was reacted with sulfur
                trioxide, it creates a fog of sulfuric acid, both harmful, and
                hard to control. The reason being is that this reaction is a
                highly exothermic reaction, meaning it would create the product
                in gaseous form.

              <p>
                The first reaction is to dissolve the sulfur trioxide in
                sulfuric acid, creating fuming sulfuric acid or oleum, which can
                then be safely reacted with water.
