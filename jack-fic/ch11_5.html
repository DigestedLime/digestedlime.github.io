                Megumi ran and left the classroom with tears. Me and Yen went to the roof. I can’t take it and said, “I am being your boyfriend just because you have that key!” She said, “this key is mine and if you want to take it back you have to satisfy me. Remember as child, we always together and play around all the time. You always sticking around with me. But what about now?! You left me and start being with this girl?! How could you forget me!”

            <div class="content">
                I didn’t realize till she said this. I said, “y-you were my childhood friend? When I’m small, I got injure due to crash over. My parents told me what happen afterward. I forgot everything before that. That key is the only thing I remember. It’s the key of Rythnider. The key that hint toward my past. I need that key.

            <div class="content">
                I’m sorry for forgetting who you are but if you keep hurting Megumi, I don’t need this key. What I want is not the past, what it matters now is the future. I care about Megumi and that’s all. Good bye” I left and went to find Megumi. Yen falls down on her lap and cried.”
