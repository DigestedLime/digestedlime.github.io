                He went to Maryam’s house for help. She was kind enough to accept him. I was the only friend Maryam actually open up to, so that’s why I know what happen.

            <div class="content">
                That day David start living in Maryam’s house, he start thinking of the way to survive, like a single wolf. He believes that everything will be his when he prove he is stronger.

                In highschool, he decide to leave the house and live alone. That day, he saw Megumi and he fall in first sight. Ever since then, he wants to take over Megumi and physically abuse her.

            <div class="content">
                But you came, you stay with Megumi all the time and that’s why there is no way he can interfere. On the school festival, he waited for the timing for you to leave the kitchen and drop the olive oil bottom without anyone notice. Then, he blamed on you.
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                He thought that would make Megumi leave you, but she didn’t. So he decide to lock you into a room and get a chance to be with Megumi. Maryam was hesitated to tell you about this because she still think David as her little brother.

            <div class="content">
                But she now decided that she doesn’t want anyone to get hurt, she wants her little brother to come back to sense.” I said, “so this is how it is...” Maryam is trying to stop him but she is not stronger than him.
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                Me and Isaac rush in and help her. Isaac stopping him while I untie Megumi. Eventually, Maryam and Isaac cannot fight. David is too strong. How is this possible?

            <div class="content">
                David said, “HaHaHa, you people cannot beat me. I had trained my boxing skill ever since I left my mom” I said, “what should I do? I have no skill and power to beat David.”
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                Looking at Megumi’s terrified face. I solidified my heart and punched him. The power is immeasurable! I can’t believe the power. He... fainted?! Next chapter: the end of fight”
